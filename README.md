# Solutions-to-Sparse-Linear-Equations
A project from my undergraduate education in Oxford towards the Prelims Computational Mathematics course. 
It provides a way to solve sparse systems of linear equations (essentially depicted by matrices with many zeroes) quickly with great accuracy.
When computational costs are too great and exact solutions are not feasible, approximate numerical algorithms can get arbitrarily close in fraction of the time.
The theory behind this implementation is only elementary linear algebra, going as far as the Moore-Penrose inverse.

The main file is projectA.m, which is compiled as projectA.pdf. It calls on all the other auxiliary files, which form the backbone of the procedure.

ProjectADescription.pdf contains all the details that the code follows - this should be consulted first before any of the other files.
